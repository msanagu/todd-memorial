        "Today, we gather to honor the life of Todd James San Agustin — a devoted son, brother, Marine, father, grandfather, and a man whose faith in Christ guided every chapter of his life.",
        "Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Priscilla and Daniel San Agustin, Todd was the youngest of three children, raised alongside his siblings Mark and Lois in a proud military household. After years of relocating as a military family, the San Agustins settled in San Diego, where Todd grew up in Chula Vista.",
        "As a young adult, Todd married Leah Venegas, and together they began their life and family. Their marriage brought forth two children, Jason and Stephanie, who remained among Todd's greatest blessings.",
        "Todd chose to serve his country. He joined the United States Marine Corps and served honorably through multiple deployments, including the Gulf War and Desert Storm. His leadership, discipline, and sense of duty reflected the values instilled in him from childhood.",
        "Todd pursued higher education and earned his Bachelor of Science from the University of Illinois, becoming the first in his family to attain an advanced degree. He went on to build a successful career in engineering and systems leadership, including serving as Vice President of Engineering and Systems at Sony. Throughout his life, Todd remained committed to supporting veterans, offering understanding and compassion shaped by his own experiences.",
        "Todd's faith was the constant thread of his life. His relationship with Christ grounded him, shaped his character, and provided enduring peace. His love for gospel, especially the music of Andraé Crouch, reflected the quiet devotion he carried throughout his life.",
        "Todd's life held both triumph and hardship. Like many who have lived greatly, he faced battles seen and unseen. But what Todd should be remembered for is the way he continued to love, to serve, and to rise. He gave generously — to his family, to his community, to his Marine brothers, and to all who crossed his path.",
        "Todd is survived by his children, Jason and Stephanie; his daughter-in-law, Mary San Agustin; and his grandchildren, Jasmine (10), twins Zion and Zuriel (10), and Titus (1). He is also survived by his brother and sister-in-law, Mark and Shari San Agustin; his sister and brother-in-law, Lois and Ed Garbett; his mother, Priscilla San Agustin; and many nieces, nephews, great-nieces, and great-nephews who adored him.",
        "Each of us carries a different memory of Todd — but all reflect the same truth. He was a fighter. A giver. A protector. A man who lived many lives, touched many hearts, and whose legacy endures in the people he loved.",
        "As we honor his life, we honor the faith that sustained him, guided him, and now brings him home. May we carry forward his courage, his kindness, his humor, and his unwavering love.",
        "May the memory of Todd James San Agustin be a lasting blessing, and may he rest in peace. Amen.",
