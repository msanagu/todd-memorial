      subtitle: "March 16, 1965 – November 16, 2025",
      paragraphs: [
        "Today, we gather to honor the life of Todd James San Agustin, a devoted son, brother, Marine, father, grandfather, and a man whose faith guided each chapter of his life.",
        "Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Priscilla and Daniel San Agustin, Todd was the youngest of three children, raised alongside his siblings Mark and Lois in a proud military household. After years of moving as a military family, they settled in San Diego, where Todd grew up in Chula Vista. Todd had a jovial, teasing spirit and a magnetic way of drawing people in. He kept lifelong friendships that felt more like brotherhoods, built on loyalty, laughter, and shared history. Whether on the football field, in church, or later in uniform, those bonds shaped the best parts of him.",
        "As a young adult, Todd married his teenage sweetheart, Leah Venegas, and together they welcomed two children, Jason and Stephanie, who remained the center of his world. Family was Todd’s greatest joy, and it was when we were gathered, connected, and experiencing life together that he was happiest.",
        "Todd answered the call to serve, joining the United States Marine Corps and serving honorably in Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War, earning the Good Conduct Medal with Bronze Star, Meritorious Unit Commendation, Letter of Commendation, and Rifle Expert Badge (2nd Award). The Marine Corps was a brotherhood for Todd, who took great pride in his service and cherished lifelong bonds with fellow Marines. He later earned a Bachelor of Science from the University of Illinois, becoming the first in his family to attain an advanced degree. He excelled in whatever he set his heart and mind to. He built a successful career in manufacturing and systems leadership, playing a key role at Sony where his innovations led to a patent.",
        "After speaking with many of Todd’s friends and family, one truth came up again and again: Todd took care of those he loved. If you were with him, you were in safe hands. He showed up quietly and consistently, without seeking recognition. People trusted him, leaned on him, and felt protected by his presence. That instinct to care for others showed up in meaningful ways. During his time at the Veterans Hospital, Todd helped create a healing garden — a space for patients and the community. It embodied the idea that with care and love, growth is always possible, just like in a garden.",
        "Todd found joy in moments that brought people together. Football remained a lifelong passion, as did his unwavering loyalty to the San Diego Padres. At family gatherings, Todd was often at the grill — a true BBQ master, making sure everyone was fed and together. Those were the moments when his happiness was most visible. As a grandfather, Todd’s gentleness shone. He took his grandchildren on small adventures, taught them how to ride bikes, and encouraged them to try again when things were hard. One of his grandsons, Zion, said it best: “I loved my Grandpa Todd so much. He was like a piece of my heart and the best grandpa ever. All he wanted me to do was be a good man and to always follow my dreams.”",
        "Todd is survived by his children, Jason and Stephanie, his daughter-in-law, Mary San Agustin; his grandchildren, Jasmine (10), twins Zion and Zuriel (10), and Titus (1); his brother and sister-in-law, Mark and Shari San Agustin; his sister and brother-in-law, Lois and Ed Garbett; his mother, Priscilla San Agustin; and many nieces and nephews who adored him.",
        "Each of us carries a different memory of Todd, but all reflect the same truth. He was a fighter. A protector. A giver. A family man whose happiest moments were spent surrounded by the people he loved. As we honor his life, we honor the faith that sustained him, the family that defined him, and the love that now carries him home.",
